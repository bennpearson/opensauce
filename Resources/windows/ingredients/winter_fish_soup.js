	text: 'The condition of most Welsh roads was poor until the late 18th century when local gentry began to build private or turnpike roads for which tolls were charged. This tollhouse was the Aberystwyth South Gate. The building and its gates cost Â£40 to erect, nearly four times what a mud and thatch cottage like Nant Wallter would have cost. It was built of local slatestone and was roofed with Pembrokeshire slates. David Jones of Dihewyd was appointed as the first gatekeeper in November 1771, the first tolls being charged on 23 March 1772.\n \n The building contains just one room, one end being used for the collection of tolls. A single fireplace at the opposite end of the house was used for heating and cooking.\n \n The house has been furnished in the style of 1843, the period of the Rebecca Riots when many tollgates were destroyed. Tollhouses were very unpopular with people in rural areas who had to pay to travel along the roads; the ensuing riots resulted in the eventual abolition of most of the Turnpike Trusts in 1864, with county councils taking over responsibility for building and maintaining the roads.\n \n CONTEMPORARY \n Although the Dragoons are in the saddle every night scouring the country here and there, they happen to be always in the wrong place, and the work of outrage continues not only undiminished but with increased and increasing audacity. This is the state of things here and there will not be a single gate standing in the country if a different mode be not adopted to put an end to it. The government are pouring in troops. A detachment of artillery are marching by way of Brecon; a detachment of artillery are marching to Carmarthen by way of Swansea; the whole of the 4th Regiment of Light Dragoons are to be stationed in South Wales; three companies of the 75th Foot are to arrive in Carmarthen within the next two or three days; the Yeomanry [volunteer cavalry troops] are kept on permanent duty, and every military appliance of the government is exercised, yet not a single outrage has been stayed nor a single Rebeccaite captured.'
